    "One of the promising applications of quantum computing is estimating the energies of a Hamiltonian. Using the quantum phase esimtation (QPE) algorithm to solve the molecular time-independent Schrodinger equation is an example of using quantum computing algorithms to find the energies of a hamiltonian. This approach has been tested exprimentally using photonic devices by using the iterative quantum phase esimtation (IOPE) method. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of interest in calculating the energy spectrum og a hamiltonian. There are various proposed methods to determine the hamiltonian spectra by the use of variational algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the witness-assisted variational eigenspectra solver (WAVES) combines the QPE and variational algorithms to find the excited states of a hamiltonian. To use this algorithm, an operator that accurately approximates the excitation from the ground state to the desired state is required, but such an operator may not be easy to derive. \n",
    "\n",
    "The orthogonally constrained variational quantum eigensolver with the unitary pair coupled cluster with generalized singles and doubles product ansatz is useful for finding low lying excited state energies. However, we need an accurate approximation of the ground state and this algorithm is only useful for low lying excited states.\n",
    "\n",
    "We develop an algorithm that samples the set of energies for a given Hamiltonian within a target energy-interval without requiring good approximations of the target energy eigenstates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ansatz will be used for a given energy interval to measure the energies of the target energy eigenstates. The algorithm is designed for cases where good approximations for the states in the target energy interval are not trival to prepare. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a hamiltonian, ansatz and target energy-interval, the algorithm amplifies the amplitudes for the states in a restricted energy interval, reducing the probability for unwanted states. This is based on quantum amplitude amplification (QAA). \n",
