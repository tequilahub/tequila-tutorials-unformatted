# Generalized Approach to ADAPT-VQE:

<img src="adaptive_general.png" width=500>

Some illustrations on how to use the generalized ADAPT-VQE approach from [arxiv:2011.05938](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05938).  
The developed automatically differentiable framework allows gradient screening on any position of the circuit.  
This enables excited state computations through a projective approach.
